### Hi there

The repositories I have here are mostly a mess. The code I write for work is not in a public repository, but you can look at the cam-flow repository which is not terrible ðŸ˜„. It is a small GUI project I made as a demo for my wifes former employer. She had been complaining about some cumbersome processes for the testing procedures in her lab, so I coded this over a weekend with her looking over my shoulder.
