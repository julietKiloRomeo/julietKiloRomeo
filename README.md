### Hi there

The repositories I have here are mostly a mess - i use them to experiment in html and javascript.

The code I write for work is not in a public repository, but you can look at the cam-flow and mastermind repositories which are not terrible ðŸ˜„.

Cam-flow is a small GUI project I made as a demo for my wifes former employer. She had been complaining about some cumbersome processes for the testing procedures in her lab, so I coded this over a weekend with her looking over my shoulder.

Mastermind is a minimal solver for mastermind I wrote in python after a vacation where we played a lot of mastermind.
